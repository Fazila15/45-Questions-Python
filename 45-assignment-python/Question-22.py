# List of cities
cities = ["Tokyo", "Paris", "New York", "Sydney", "Cape Town"]

# Trying to access an index that doesn't exist (out of range)
print(cities[10])  # This will cause an IndexError

# Correcting the error by using a valid index
print(cities[2])  # This is valid, and will print "New York"
